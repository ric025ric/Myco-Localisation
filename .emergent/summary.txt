The AI engineer systematically developed a GPS mushroom finder application for Android, utilizing an Expo React Native frontend and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. Initial work established core features like location tracking, mushroom spot management (with type, notes, and base64 photos), and map/list views. Recurring challenges included managing cross-platform compatibility for  and , and persistent Metro bundler caching, which often required aggressive clearing. Significant enhancements involved implementing a French/English multi-language system and a Localiser ma Voiture feature for saving and navigating back to parking spots. UI/UX was iteratively refined with a dark forest background and a 2x2 button grid. The current focus is on resolving native APK deployment issues related to backend URL accessibility, with the user having paid for a Google Play Developer account. The AI is now preparing the backend for public cloud deployment using Render.com.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an Android application to mark GPS points for mushroom findings in forests, named Myco Localisation. The application's core functionality includes saving mushroom spots with GPS coordinates, type, notes, and base64 encoded photos, displaying these spots in a list, on a map, and enabling navigation to them.

Key feature additions include a multi-language system (French/English) and a Localiser ma Voiture feature. This allows users to save their car's parking location, retrieve it, navigate back using Google Maps, and delete previously saved locations, enhancing safety during foraging. The user also requested significant UI/UX improvements: replacing the home screen's black background with a dark forest image, renaming the app from Mushroom Finder to Myco Localisation, and reorganizing the main navigation buttons into a compact 2x2 grid for improved aesthetics and usability. The ultimate goal is public distribution via the Google Play Store, requiring a robust, publicly accessible backend for the native Android APK.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Modifications:**

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** FastAPI backend handling CRUD operations for  data, including , , , , , , and . Connects to MongoDB via .
    -   **Changes:** Implemented initial FastAPI endpoints for mushroom spot management.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Stores environment-specific variables, crucially .
    -   **Changes:** Repeatedly updated to resolve connectivity issues across various development and deployment stages (local IP, Expo tunnel, now aiming for a public cloud URL).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** The application's main home screen and entry point.
    -   **Changes:** Integrates  for translations, handles location permissions, and implements the Localiser ma Voiture feature with  for persistence,  for navigation, and a delete option. The UI was visually transformed with an  (dark forest theme), a subtle overlay, and a 2x2 grid layout for primary navigation buttons with enhanced styling and colors.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Screen for users to add new mushroom spots.
    -   **Changes:** Updated for multi-language support, integrates  for GPS coordinates and  for photo capture (with web compatibility checks). Submits data, including base64 images, to the backend.
-   ** & **:
    -   **Importance:** Display lists and detailed views of saved mushroom spots.
    -   **Changes:** Both updated to support multiple languages.  was modified to use  instead of  for opening map navigation, resolving mobile compatibility issues.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Dedicated screen for application settings.
    -   **Changes:** Created to provide an interface for users to select between French and English, utilizing the .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Component for displaying mushroom spots on a map.
    -   **Changes:** Modified to include platform-specific rendering to ensure basic functionality on web (with a fallback view) while utilizing  on mobile.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Centralized context for global language state and translation functions.
    -   **Changes:** Newly created file, containing French and English translation JSON data, and persisting the user's language preference using .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Expo project configuration.
    -   **Changes:** Updated application name to Myco Localisation and added necessary device permissions (e.g., location, camera, storage) for native builds.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Configuration file for deploying the backend service on Render.com.
    -   **Changes:** Newly created to prepare the backend for public cloud deployment.

<pending_tasks>
-   Deploy the FastAPI backend to a public cloud service (e.g., Render.com) to secure a permanent, globally accessible API.
-   Update the  in the frontend's  file with the URL of the newly deployed public backend.
-   Rebuild the native Android APK with the corrected backend URL for public distribution.
-   Finalize the submission and publishing process on the Google Play Store.

<current_work>
Currently, the AI engineer is addressing the critical issue of the Myco Localisation app not functioning correctly when installed as a native Android APK. The primary cause identified is the inaccessibility of the backend API URL from the natively installed application, as the previous  () was designed for development/tunneling and not public deployment.

To resolve this, the immediate task is to deploy the FastAPI backend to a public cloud service. The AI engineer has just created a  file in the  root directory. This file contains the necessary configuration for deploying the backend application on Render.com, a cloud hosting provider chosen for its free tier and suitability for FastAPI. The next step is to use this configuration to deploy the backend, obtain a stable public URL, and then update the frontend's  to point to this new, accessible API. This will enable the natively installed app to save mushroom spots, retrieve lists, and utilize map navigation as intended, paving the way for public release on the Google Play Store.
